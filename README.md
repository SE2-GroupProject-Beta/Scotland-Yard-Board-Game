Scotland Yard Board Game for Android
## objectives
This is a clone of a software project we were doing at a software engineering course at university. It features the implementation of the board-game "Scotland Yard" in an android version. I am trying to finish a running version for Android.
## steps
- Refactor and make the code testable
- Implement CI
- Change code to two-player game
- add features slowly at/after refactoring
